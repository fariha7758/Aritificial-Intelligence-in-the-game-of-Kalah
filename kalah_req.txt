Requirements

Install python 3.7, tensorflow 1.14, gym 0.19, stable-baselines 2.10 and run main.py 

Addition of iterative deepening seach (IDS) to Alpha Beta pruning algorithm which should help 
with searching for deeper levels without taking too much time and the option should appear 
on the menu in alpha-beta pruning as the 4 option with "Play with IDS".

And the second modification is to set a timer to play the game for each move for each player
(assigning each player 2 seconds or 5 seconds per move so that i can calculate and set
the time required to play 1000 games or more (as in the game of chess)).
This should be done for all the 3 algorithms.

There is timing set  for the max execution time which can be removed as it is not required.

Adding and storing the exact time each move took from the allocated time in the csv files 
already used together with the winner and player 1 score and player 2 score.
